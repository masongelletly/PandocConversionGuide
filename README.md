# Pandoc Conversion Guide
https://github.com/masongelletly/PandocConversionGuide by Mason Gelletly

This project provides user documentation meant to guide the user through the installation and use of Pandoc software. The guide will focus on using Pandoc to convert Word files to Markdown, and Markdown files to Word.

To use this documentation, open the index.md file. This file acts as a table of contents for the documentation and will allow you to access each and every portion of instruction. This file is pivotal, as any and all traversal between files relies on index.md.

Goodluck, and happy Pandoc-ing!
